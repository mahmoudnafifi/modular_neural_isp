# 🖼️ Photo-Editing Tool

Secs. 2.6 and I of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08564) describe our photo-editing tool, which is built on top of our modular ISP.  
The backend implementation is located in [`main`](../main), while this `gui` contains the front-end interface and launch script.

  
The tool accepts:
- **DNGs** from any camera,
- **JPEG images produced by our tool** (with embedded raw for re-rendering),
- **PNG/JPEG sRGB images** generated by any third-party source.

The tool provides several image-editing options, including full control over the **photofinishing pipeline** with multiple picture styles.
