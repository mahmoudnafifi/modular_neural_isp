# 🖼️ Photo-Editing Tool

Secs. 2.6 and I of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08564) describe our photo-editing tool, which is built on top of our modular ISP.  
The backend implementation is located in [`main`](../main), while this `gui` contains the front-end interface and launch script.

  
The tool accepts:
- **DNGs** from any camera,
- **JPEG images produced by our tool** (with embedded raw for re-rendering),
- **PNG/JPEG sRGB images** generated by any third-party source.

The tool provides several image-editing options, including full control over the **photofinishing pipeline** with multiple picture styles.

## ▶️ Get Started

To launch the tool, run:

```bash
python run_photo_editing_tool.py
```



To run the tool in full-screen mode, add `--full-screen`.

## 📦 Download Executables

Pre-built standalone executables of the photo-editing tool are available.  
Each package includes **all required dependencies** and runs **without installing Python or external libraries**.

### Versions

**v0.1.5 (Beta)** 

| Platform | Package | Download | Size | Notes |
|----------|--------|----------|------|-------|
| **Windows (64-bit)** | `PhotoEditingTool-v0.1.5-win64.zip` | [📥 Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-AjxoECQ8HureT0zzV5w0C4j5B-yzVR8/view?usp=sharingum) | 2.4 GB | Primary development platform. Supports WB editing for DNG files **when standard metadata is available**. GPU acceleration recommended. |
| **macOS (Apple Silicon)** | `PhotoEditingTool-v0.1.5-macos-arm64.zip` | [📥 Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ar2lxa_jEu9AzkL3lJhI-bm6MyUL0rCG/view?usp=sharing) | 233 MB | **Partial MPS support** (unsupported operators may fall back to CPU). WB editing for DNGs is supported **only if standard metadata is present**. Performance is not yet optimized.|


**v0.1.0 (Beta)**

| Platform | Package | Download | Size | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------|------|-------|
| **Windows (64-bit)** | `PhotoEditingTool-v0.1.0-win64.zip` | [📥 Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mU-QjsNUH9SJ-EygelGvenVQCxVsY4D1/view?usp=sharing) | 2.4 GB | Primary development platform. Custom AWB is not available in the prebuilt binary — run the source code if custom AWB functionality is needed. |

### ▶️ How to Run 

#### Windows

1. Download `PhotoEditingTool-vx.x.x-win64.zip`
2. Extract the zip file
3. Open the extracted folder
4. Double-click `PhotoEditingTool.exe`

> 💡 If Windows SmartScreen appears, click **More info → Run anyway**.

#### macOS

1. Download `PhotoEditingTool-vx.x.x-macos-arm64.zip`
2. Extract the zip file
3. Open the extracted folder
4. Double-click `Launch_PhotoEditingTool.command`

> 💡 On first run, macOS Gatekeeper may block execution.  
> Right-click the file → Open → Open to confirm.

> 💡 If macOS reports that the file cannot be executed, open Terminal in the folder and run:
> ```bash
> chmod +x Launch_PhotoEditingTool.command
> ```

> 💡 If macOS reports that the app is "damaged" or cannot be opened, run:
> ```bash
> xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine .
> ```

> 💡 A Terminal window may appear and remain open briefly before the GUI is shown.  
> This is expected for the beta version.


### 📝 Notes

- This is a beta release intended for research and evaluation.
- The package is large because it bundles deep learning models, the PyTorch runtime, and required native dependencies.
- White-balance (WB) editing for DNG files is supported only when standard metadata is available. For full support, use the source code; ExifTool is recommended.
- When running on CPU, performance is expected to be slow. For a better experience, GPU acceleration is recommended.
- Apple Silicon (MPS) is partially supported --- unsupported operators may fall back to CPU execution.
- To speed up execution, you can disable the refinement step of local tone mapping and use standard local tone mapping (`Settings → Local Tone Mapping → Standard`).
- Tested on macOS Sonoma (Apple Silicon) and expected to work on recent macOS versions.
- The macOS build is not yet performance-optimized, and runtime performance may be slower than on Windows/Linux.
- Platform-specific performance optimizations may be explored in future releases.
