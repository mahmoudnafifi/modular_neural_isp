# 🖼️ Photo-Editing Tool

Secs. 2.6 and I of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08564) describe our photo-editing tool, which is built on top of our modular ISP.  
The backend implementation is located in [`main`](../main), while this `gui` contains the front-end interface and launch script.

  
The tool accepts:
- **DNGs** from any camera,
- **JPEG images produced by our tool** (with embedded raw for re-rendering),
- **PNG/JPEG sRGB images** generated by any third-party source.

The tool provides several image-editing options, including full control over the **photofinishing pipeline** with multiple picture styles.

## ▶️ Get Started

To launch the tool, run:

```bash
python run_photo_editing_tool.py
```

If you are running from the repository root, use:

```bash
python gui/run_photo_editing_tool.py
```

To run the tool in full-screen mode, add `--full-screen`.

### 📝 Notes

- This is a beta release intended for research and evaluation.
- The package is large because it bundles deep learning models, the PyTorch runtime, and required native dependencies.
- Some optional features (e.g., EXIF metadata extraction) may be skipped automatically if unavailable.
- Tested on macOS Sonoma (Apple Silicon) and expected to work on recent macOS versions.
- The macOS build is not yet performance-optimized, and runtime performance may differ from Windows/Linux.
- Platform-specific performance optimizations may be explored in future releases.
